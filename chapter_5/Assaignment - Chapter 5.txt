Assaignment - Chapter 5
=========================

#1: Are You Rich?
-------------------
What do you think the following code will do? Try to figure out the answer without typing it into the shell, and then check your answer.

>>> money = 2000
>>> if money > 1000:
 print("I'm rich!!")
else:
 print("I'm not rich!!")
 print("But I might be later...")


 #2: Twinkies!
 ---------------
Create an if statement that checks whether a number of Twinkies (in the variable twinkies) is less than 100 or greater than 500. Your program should print the message “Too few or too many” if the condition is true.

#3: Just the Right Number
--------------------------
Create an if statement that checks whether the amount of money contained in the variable money is between 100 and 500 or between 1,000 and 5,000.

#4: I Can Fight Those Ninjas
------------------------------
Create an if statement that prints the string “That’s too many” if the variable ninjas contains a number that’s less than 50, prints “It’ll be a struggle, but I can take ’em” if it’s less than 30, and prints “I can fight those ninjas!” if it’s less than 10. You might try out your code with:

>>> ninjas = 5

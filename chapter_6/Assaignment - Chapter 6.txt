#1: The Hello Loop
What do you think the following code will do? First, guess what
will happen, and then run the code in Python to see if you were
right.
>>> for x in range(0, 20):
 print('hello %s' % x)
 if x < 9:
 break
Going Loopy 79
#2: Even Numbers
Create a loop that prints even numbers until it reaches your year
of age or, if your age is an odd number, prints out odd numbers
until it reaches your age. For example, it might print out something like this:
2
4
6
8
10
12
14
#3: My Five Favorite Ingredients
Create a list containing five different sandwich ingredients, suchas the following:
>>> ingredients = ['snails', 'leeches', 'gorilla belly-button lint',
 'caterpillar eyebrows', 'centipede toes']
Now create a loop that prints out the list (including the numbers):
1 snails
2 leeches
3 gorilla belly-button lint
4 caterpillar eyebrows
5 centipede toes
#4: Your Weight on the Moon
If you were standing on the moon right now, your weight would be
16.5 percent of what it is on Earth. You can calculate that by multiplying your Earth weight by 0.165.
If you gained a kilo in weight every year for the next 15 years,
what would your weight be when you visited the moon each year
and at the end of the 15 years? Write a program using a for loop
that prints your moon weight for each year.

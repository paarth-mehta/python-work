#1: Basic Moon
Weight Function
In Chapter 6, one programming
puzzle was to create a for loop to
determine your weight on the moon
over a period of 15 years. That for
loop could easily be turned into a
function. Try creating a function
that takes a starting weight and
increases the weight amount each
year. You might call the new function using code like this:
>>> moon_weight(30, 0.25)
#2: Moon Weight Function and Years
Take the function youâ€™ve just created, and change it to work out
the weight over different periods, such as 5 years or 20 years. Be
sure to change the function so that it takes three arguments: initial weight, weight gained each year, and number of years:
>>> moon_weight(90, 0.25, 5)
#3: Moon Weight Program
Instead of a simple function, where you pass in the values as
parameters, you can make a mini-program that prompts for the
values using sys.stdin.readline(). In this case, you call the function
without any parameters at all:
moon_weight()
Recycling Your Code with Functions and Modules 91
The function will display a message asking for the starting
weight, then a second message asking for the amount the weight
will increase each year, and finally a message asking for the number of years. You would see something like the following:
Please enter your current Earth weight
45
Please enter the amount your weight might increase each year
0.4
Please enter the number of years
12
Remember to import the sys module first before creating your
function:
>>> import sys
